This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

At the end of the course session, one must properly solicit feedback from the enrolled
students to improve the course structure and outcomes. For this reason, there is a requirement for a simple and hassle-free application that will allow faculty to post the course exit survey.
Alongside supporting Automation (Opening and Closing of Course Exit Survey auto-
matically instead of faculty doing it manually) and students to fill out the Course Exit Survey accordingly. Our projectâ€™s principal objective is to make this task uncomplicated and simple. To help students and faculty better understand the course experience and outcomes, aim of this project is  to develop an online PG Accreditation Course Exit Survey and Course Survey application.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
